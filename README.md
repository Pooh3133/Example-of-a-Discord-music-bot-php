# Example-of-a-Discord-music-bot-php
Here is a simple example of how you might create a Discord music bot using PHP

``` <?php

// Load the Discord API library

require_once 'discord-api.php';

// Set your Discord bot token and client ID

$bot_token = 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN';

$client_id = 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID';

// Create a new Discord API client

$client = new DiscordClient($bot_token, $client_id);

// Register a command to play a song

$client->on('!play', function($message, $args) use ($client) {

  // Parse the song URL from the command arguments

  $song_url = $args[0];

  // Find the voice channel the user is in

  $voice_channel = $client->getUserVoiceChannel($message['author']['id']);

  // Join the voice channel

  $client->joinVoiceChannel($voice_channel['id']);

  // Play the song in the voice channel

  $client->playAudio($song_url);

});

// Run the bot

$client->run();
```

This code will create a Discord bot that responds to the !play command by joining the voice channel the user is in and playing a song from the specified URL.

You'll need to install the Discord API library and provide your own bot token and client ID in order to use this code. You can learn more about creating a Discord bot and obtaining these credentials at the Discord developer portal (https://discord.com/developers/).

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
